A Social Media platform for the future.

_PeopleCat Â© Nathcat 2024_

## Usage
In order to run the server, download a compiled jar package from the releases page, and create the following
directory structure:

```
Assets/
    Data/
    MySQL_Config.json
PeopleCat-Server.jar
```

`MySQL_Config.json` should contain a JSON object which gives information
on how the server should connect to the required MySQL Server:

```json
{
  "connection_url_peoplecat": "jdbc:mysql://hostname.of.server/PeopleCat",
  "username": "Username to connect with",
  "password": "Password to connect with"
}
```

## MySQL Setup
An SQL script to setup the MySQL is included in this repository: `PeopleCat_DB.sql`.
